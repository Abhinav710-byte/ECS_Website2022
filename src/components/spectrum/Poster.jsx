            Photographs bear witness to stories that words fail to recite. It is
            the poetry written with the ink of light on the canvas of shadow,

            is back again with its segment MOMENTS, so grab your cameras and
            venture to click some breathtaking stories. Get ready to play with
            light, capture the stories of shadows against the vermillion
            sunsets, the bright noons, the light of your room, and the gleaming
            moonlight, because this year's theme is silhouette photography.

            The feeling of creating something that is useful to a tonne of
            people and makes their lives easier is indeed a really great
            feeling. A developer surely gets this feeling as one creates an app
            and watches many users use it. An app with the most suitable
            features to please the user with utility, productivity as well as
            creativity, is one of the most cherishable tokens provided to us.
            ECS brings to you Smartdroid 3.0, a hackathon focusing on Android
            development, where you will be working either individually or in
            teams on the problem statement provided. So wake up that developer
            within you and show us your originality and creativity in this
            hackathon
